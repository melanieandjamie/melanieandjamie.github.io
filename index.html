    <b>Important note about short-term rentals (AirBnB, VRBO, etc.) in NYC!</b></br>Effective March 2023, New York City has passed a <a href="https://portal.311.nyc.gov/article/?kanumber=KA-03559" target="_blank">local law</a> that prohibits hosts from renting out an entire apartment or home to visitors for fewer than 30 days. Short-term rentals of less than 30 days are only permitted if the host stays in the same apartment as the guest, limits the rental to no more than 2 guests, and pre-registers with the Mayor's Office. Given this, we are not recommending Airbnb or Vrbo for our wedding guests.</text>
      <div class="section">Transportation</div>
      <text>There are 3 airports you can fly into in the NYC area:</text>
        <text><ol>
          <li>LGA is by far the most convenient to the venue (~20 min by car), but it does not have as many direct flight options.</li>
          <li>JFK is the second best in terms of convenience and has more flight options. It is 2 trains from the venue or 40 min by car without traffic.</li>
          <li>EWR is comparable to JFK by car but more complicated by public transit. It is 4 trains from the venue or 40 min by car without traffic.</li>
      </ol></text>
      <text>There are also many buses and trains that will drop you at convenient transportation hubs in the city.</text>

  <div id="faqs"></div>
  <div>
    <div class="pgheader">FAQs</div>
    <div class="section">Is there a dress code?</div>
    <text>We would love to celebrate with you in whatever you like to wear for special occasions. If that's extremely formal, go for it! If
      that's more dressy casual, also great! Clothing from any culture is welcome and feel free to wear any color
      (including white). Festive colors encouraged!</text>

    <div class="section">Will we be indoors or outdoors?</div>
    <text>All of the wedding events will take place in one air-conditioned building. There is a small side courtyard for
      those who need to step out for a quick break. There will be no need to walk on grass or soft surfaces so heels
      are fine. If you are planning to go out in Williamsburg afterward, you may want comfortable walking shoes.</text>

    <div class="section">Are kids welcome?</div>
    <text>Yes definitely! We will be serving alcohol and we may play music with explicit lyrics, so we respect
      whatever you feel is best for your kids. If a young child needs a quiet room to nap, we can accommodate
      this.</text>

    <div class="section">Is there parking at the venue?</div>
    <text>No. We recommend using a ridshare/taxi or taking the subway. If you really prefer to drive your own car, <a
        href="https://spothero.com/search?kind=address&latitude=40.7101123&longitude=-73.9623258&search_string=Weylin%2C+Broadway%2C+Brooklyn%2C+NY%2C+USA&starts=2023-01-28T16%3A00&ends=2023-01-28T23%3A30"><text
          style="text-decoration:underline">SpotHero</text></a> is a great app to find parking deals. Two nearby
      parking facilities are located at 110 Broadway
      (~$22) and 75 S 6th St (~$11).</text>
    
     <div class="section">Is there an elevator at the venue?</div>
     <text>Most guests will go up and down one flight of stairs to transition between spaces in the venue. However, if you need to avoid stairs, you can 
    enter through the side entrance of the building and use the elevator. Please reach out if you have any further concerns/questions or ask a staff member for help when you arrive.</text>

    <div class="section">How do I RSVP?</div>
    <text>You can RSVP through your Greenvelope invitation which you will receive in a couple months by email.</text>

    <div class="section">What does Mango look like and will he be part of the ceremony?</div>
    <text>Mango will be celebrating privately with friends of his own species.</text></br>
